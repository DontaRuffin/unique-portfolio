## "What is neo-brutalism in web design?"

Help improve our product

We made two versions of this answer. Which do you prefer?

Neo-brutalism in web design is a bold, unpolished aesthetic trend inspired by brutalist architecture, emphasizing raw functionality over sleek refinement.[nngroup +1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/neobrutalism/)

## Key Characteristics

Designs feature high-contrast colors, thick borders, oversized typography, and blocky layouts that feel intentionally unfinished. Elements like exposed grids, clashing hues, and minimal styling prioritize impact and authenticity, often drawing from 90s nostalgia.[bejamas +3](https://bejamas.com/blog/neubrutalism-web-design-trend)

## Differences from Brutalism

Unlike pure brutalism's stark, utilitarian minimalism (e.g., plain HTML and monochrome palettes), neo-brutalism adds vibrant pops of color, subtle animations, and structured playfulness for better accessibility. This makes it more approachable for modern sites like portfolios or startups.[cccreative +2](https://www.cccreative.design/blogs/brutalism-vs-neubrutalism-in-ui-design)

## Use Cases

Ideal for creative agencies, personal brands, or disruptive SaaS tools, it cuts through visual clutter by embracing asymmetry and raw elements. Examples include experimental agency sites with disruptive hovers and Figma-inspired interfaces blending edge with usability.[618media +2](https://618media.com/en/blog/neo-brutalism-raw-aesthetics-in-web-design/)
